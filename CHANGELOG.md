# Changelog

All notable changes to the Teamleader Focus SDK for Laravel will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- GraphQL support when available from Teamleader API
- Bulk operations helper for processing large datasets
- Enhanced caching strategies with tag-based invalidation
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Laravel Pulse integration for monitoring
- CLI tool for quick API exploration

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- **Method Signature Compatibility in Subscriptions Resource**
    - Fixed `buildSort()` method signature in `Subscriptions` resource to match parent `Resource` class
    - Changed from `buildSort(array $sort): array` to `buildSort($sort, string $order = 'desc'): array`
    - Removed strict `array` type hint to support flexible parameter types (string, array, or structured array)
    - Added `$order` parameter with default value `'desc'` to maintain compatibility with parent class
    - Prevents fatal error: "Declaration of buildSort() must be compatible with parent class"

### Changed
- Updated `Subscriptions::buildSort()` to handle multiple input formats:
    - String sort field: `'field_name'`
    - Simple array: `['field' => 'name', 'order' => 'asc']`
    - Structured sort array: `[['field' => 'name', 'order' => 'asc']]`

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- **Method Visibility for Inheritance Compatibility**
    - Changed `buildFilters()` and `buildSort()` methods from `private` to `protected` visibility in multiple resource classes
    - Ensures proper inheritance hierarchy and prevents PHP access level violations
    - Fixes fatal error: "Access level to [Resource]::buildSort() must be protected (as in class Resource) or weaker"

  **Affected files:**
    - `src/Resources/General/Departments.php`
    - `src/Resources/General/Users.php`
    - `src/Resources/General/Teams.php`
    - `src/Resources/General/WorkTypes.php`
    - `src/Resources/Projects/LegacyMilestones.php`
    - `src/Resources/Deals/LostReasons.php`
    - `src/Resources/Deals/Sources.php`
    - `src/Resources/Invoicing/Invoices.php`

### Changed
- Standardized method visibility across all resource classes for consistent inheritance behavior
- All helper methods used by parent class now use `protected` visibility instead of `private`
